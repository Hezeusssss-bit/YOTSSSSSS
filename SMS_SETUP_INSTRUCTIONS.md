### Step 3: Add API Key to Your Project

   ```
4. Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your **actual API key** from Step 2
5. Save the `.env` file
6. **Example:**
   ```
   SEMAPHORE_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** After adding the API key to `.env`, restart your Laravel server if it's running!

4. **Check Logs**: Look in `storage/logs/laravel.log` for error messages

### How to Check if SMS Was Sent (Simulation Mode)

While in simulation mode (no API key set), check:
